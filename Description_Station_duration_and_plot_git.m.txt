Brief Description:Station_duration_and_plot_git.m
This MATLAB script processes broadband seismic station metadata from a Station.txt file. It calculates the duration of station operation, filters stations based on their operational time, and generates geospatial visualizations of station locations.

Key Features:
Extracts and Processes Station Data:

Reads network, station, latitude, longitude, elevation, and time duration from Station.txt.
Handles missing end times by assigning a future end date (2599-12-31) for active stations.
Computes the operational duration of each station in years.
Filters and Categorizes Data:

Saves an updated station metadata file that includes computed durations.
Separates stations that have been operational for more than 5 years and saves them in a separate file.
Saves Processed Data:

Writes station metadata into text files (.txt).
Outputs separate files for:
All stations with computed durations
Stations operational for more than 5 years
Geospatial Visualization of Stations:

Generates two maps using the Lambert projection:
Figure 1: All broadband stations plotted with US state boundaries.
Figure 2: Stations operating for more than 5 years highlighted separately.
Includes station counts in the plots for better interpretation.

How to Use:
Ensure Station.txt is available in the same directory as the script.
Run the script in MATLAB.

The script will generate:
Processed station metadata files.
Maps visualizing broadband station locations.
A separate list of long-operating (>5 years) stations.
This script is useful for seismic network station metadata filtering, duration analysis, and geospatial visualization of receiver function stations.
