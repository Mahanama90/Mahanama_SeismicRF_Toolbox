Brief Description:Channel_filtering_git.m
This MATLAB script processes and analyzes channel metadata from a Channel.txt file, which contains details such as network, station, location, channel, elevation, and sampling rate. 

To create your own Channel.txt visit https://service.iris.edu/fdsnws/station/docs/1/builder/ and choose Channel under Level category and download a .txt file using the URL "Click the Link" option

The script performs the following tasks:

Reads and Parses the Channel Data

Extracts relevant parameters including station and network information, geographic coordinates, and sensor metadata.
Computes Channel Durations

Converts station start and end times to a datetime format, and computes the operational duration of each station in years.

Categorizes stations based on their operational time (e.g., less than 1 year, more than 5 years, etc.).
Filters and Organizes Data by Sampling Rate

Extracts unique sampling rates and counts the number of channels for each rate.
Separates 40 Hz and 100 Hz sampling rate channels into distinct output files.

Summarizes Channel and Station Statistics

Outputs the number of channels and unique stations for each duration category.
Displays a formatted table of sampling rates and their distribution across duration categories.

How to Use:
Ensure Channel.txt is available in the same directory as the script.
Run the script in MATLAB to generate filtered channel metadata and duration statistics.

The script outputs tables in the MATLAB console and saves filtered datasets for specific sampling rates.
