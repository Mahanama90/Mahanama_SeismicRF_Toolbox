Brief Description:Channel_station_filtering_git.m
This MATLAB script processes receiver function (RF) channel metadata from a Channel.txt file. It performs several key tasks to analyze and organize broadband seismic station data based on their operational duration and sampling rates.

Key Features:
Extracts and Processes Station Data:

Reads network, station, location, channel, latitude, longitude, sampling rate, and time duration from the Channel.txt file.
Computes the operational duration of each station in years.
Filters and Categorizes Data:

Adds a duration column to the station dataset.
Filters stations that have been operational for 5 or more years.
Further separates these stations based on 40 Hz and 100 Hz sampling rates.
Saves Processed Data:

Writes datasets into text files (.txt) and tabular files (.csv).
Filters and outputs distinct station and channel lists based on duration and sampling rates.
Geospatial Visualization of Stations:

Generates two maps displaying station availability for 40 Hz and 100 Hz channels using Lambert projection.
Plots station locations with labels and state boundaries.
Formats and Saves Data in a Readable Structure:

Groups data by station ID and retains unique locations and channels.
Converts date-time values and station coordinates into a structured table.
Outputs tables as both CSV and TXT files for further analysis.

How to Use:
Ensure Channel.txt is available in the same directory as the script.

Run the script in MATLAB.
The script will generate:
Filtered station lists for different time and sampling rate conditions.
Formatted tables with station metadata and durations.
Maps visualizing broadband station locations.
This script is useful for receiver function analysis, seismic station/channel metadata filtering, and broadband seismic station/network visualization.
